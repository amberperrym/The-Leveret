        <h3>About The Leveret</h3>
        <br>

          <p>Amber Perry is pursuing her masters in Information Studies at McGill University. Here, she is particularly interested in how we judge the authenticity of cultural heritage and, especially, the role that narrative plays in content development and dissemination. Her other main scholarly interests are literary: Gothic literature, contemporary poetry that appropriates the gothic mode, and ecocriticism. She is also excited about gardening and hiking!</p>
